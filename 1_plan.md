Read PLAN.md and PROMPT.md for the full project specification.
Read STATUS.md for current project state — find the first chunk not marked [x] and
marked "ready". That is the chunk to plan (referred to as {N.N} below).
Read CHUNK-1.1-PLAN.md as an example of the format and level of detail expected.

Write a detailed implementation plan for the next ready chunk from STATUS.md
to the file CHUNK-{N.N}-PLAN.md. Include:
- File creation order with dependency reasoning
- Complete class specifications (properties, constructor, all methods with signatures)
- Full code templates for every file
- Acceptance test procedures
- Implementation notes and edge cases

The plan must account for code already implemented in previous chunks.
Do not duplicate or rewrite existing code — build on top of it.
